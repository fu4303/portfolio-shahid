# Portfolio 2.0 👋🏻
I made this Portfolio because the previous one had too much of text. The new one is inspired by [Britanny Chiang's Portfolio Website](https://github.com/bchiang7). Even though I took clues from her design, I developed the entire website on my own. Please reach out to me if you have any doubts or questions.
